# GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY AND SCOPE

Governance Layer: v1.0


---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **internal governance authority**, **decision-making scope**, and
**binding governance effects** applicable within the GHI project.

It serves to identify the competent internal body empowered to:
- define and delimit project scope,
- exclude topics or activities,
- freeze or invalidate documented phases,
- and declare non-reusability of materials for project purposes.

This document is normative at the internal governance level of the GHI project.

---

## 2. Governing Authority

The **GHI Project Governance Authority** is the internal body designated to issue governance
decisions within the scope of the GHI project.

This authority operates independently from:
- technical implementation,
- development activities,
- publication pipelines,
- and any external integration or use.

Its mandate includes, without limitation:
- approving or excluding project phases,
- freezing or invalidating documented work,
- defining scope exclusions,
- enforcing governance constraints across project repositories and publications.

---

## 3. Binding Governance Effect

Governance decisions issued by the GHI Project Governance Authority are:

- authoritative within the project context,
- binding for all project-related activities and materials,
- applicable to all contributors, past or present, insofar as they act within the project scope.

Any work, documentation, or analysis produced in violation of a governance decision
is deemed **non-actionable and inapplicable within the GHI project**, irrespective of
its technical correctness.

---

## 4. Prospective and Retroactive Application

Governance decisions apply:

- **prospectively**, from the date of issuance, and
- **retroactively**, to prior phases, documents, and materials,
  strictly for the purposes of internal governance, scope control,
  and documentary consistency within the project.

Such retroactive application does not constitute a legal nullification
outside the GHI project context.

---

## 5. Enforcement Principle

Enforcement is exercised through **scope control and internal invalidation**,
not through disciplinary measures or individual sanctions.

Accordingly:
- reuse of frozen or excluded materials constitutes a governance violation,
- any resulting output is void **for GHI project purposes only**,
- such output may not be referenced, published, or relied upon as part of the project.

---

## 6. Relationship to Frozen Phases

Frozen phases, as declared by governance notices, are:

- excluded from the active project scope,
- non-transferable,
- non-reusable,
- and non-derivable within the project.

Their preservation is limited to archival and audit purposes and confers
no right of reuse, continuation, or activation within the GHI project.

---

## 7. Precedence

In case of interpretation conflict, **governance documents prevail** over:
- methodological documentation,
- technical specifications,
- design notes,
- exploratory or preparatory materials.

This document has precedence over all phase-level documentation.

---

## 8. Status

This document is:
- public,
- normative for internal governance,
- non-contractual,
- and effective upon publication.
