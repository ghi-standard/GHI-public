1. Absolute and Permanent Exclusion

Phase 2.4 is hereby formally, absolutely, and permanently excluded from the scope of the GHI project.

This exclusion applies without limitation and without exception to:
	•	all governance change, evolution, or review processes,
	•	any versioning, release, roadmap, or publication schemes,
	•	any form of methodological evolution, refinement, clarification, or reinterpretation,
	•	any operational, technical, architectural, analytical, or strategic consideration.

⸻

2. Prohibition of Interpretive Characterization

Phase 2.4 shall not, under any circumstance or interpretive framework, be construed as:
	•	preparatory,
	•	enabling,
	•	anticipatory,
	•	capability-building,
	•	transitional,
	•	or indicative of any future capability, intent, trajectory, or direction.

No contextual reading, inferred intent, structural proximity, or historical sequencing
may be invoked to suggest otherwise.

3. Irreversibility, Non-Conditionality, and Temporal Effect

This exclusion is absolute, irreversible, and non-conditional, and operates prospectively only.

It is unaffected by, and shall not be altered, reopened, suspended, or weakened by:
	•	governance restructuring or succession,
	•	changes in leadership or contributors,
	•	external usage, adoption, or dependency,
	•	regulatory, legal, or institutional developments.

4. Loss of Relevance and Archival Status

Phase 2.4 carries no legal, technical, methodological, strategic, or governance relevance
within the GHI project.

Any remaining reference to Phase 2.4 exists solely as a non-operative archival record, which is:
	•	devoid of normative authority,
	•	devoid of interpretive weight,
	•	devoid of decision-making value,
	•	and incapable of producing legal, methodological, or strategic effects.

⸻

5. Override and Supremacy Clause

Any interpretation, reference, citation, reliance, or use of Phase 2.4 that is inconsistent
with this Institutional Exclusion Notice is expressly overridden, nullified, and without effect
within the GHI project.

This notice derives its authority from, and operates under, the
GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY AND INTERPRETIVE SCOPE instrument, which retains supreme interpretive force.
