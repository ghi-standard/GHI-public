# SCOPE EXCLUSION NOTICE
## External LIVE Data Ingestion — Governance Exclusion (v1.0)

---

## 1. Purpose

This governance instrument prospectively excludes the topic commonly described as “external LIVE data ingestion” from the GHI project scope unless and until a dedicated governance act explicitly re-includes it.

This document is normative at the governance level.

---

## 2. Scope Exclusion (Prospective)

As of publication of this notice, the following are excluded from the GHI project scope:

- any initiative framed as external LIVE data ingestion,
- any activity implying real-time connection to external data sources for index production,
- any operationalization of “live ingestion” concepts, regardless of naming conventions.

This exclusion applies irrespective of terminology used in lower-ranked documents.

---

## 3. No Implicit Re-Inclusion

No phase, methodology text, technical note, architectural document, or repository artifact may be construed as re-including the excluded scope by implication, context, or adjacency.

Re-inclusion requires a governance-level act that:
- expressly states re-inclusion,
- defines scope boundaries,
- and states effective date and applicability.

---

## 4. Non-Admission

This notice does not amend, correct, or restate any prior publication, and does not acknowledge any defect or gap. It operates prospectively as a governance scope control.

---

## 5. Effect

Effective upon publication.
