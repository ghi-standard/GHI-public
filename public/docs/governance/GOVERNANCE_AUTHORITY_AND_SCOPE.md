# GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY AND INTERPRETIVE SCOPE

**Governance Layer:** v1.0  
**Status:** Normative — Controlling Authority  
**Scope:** Project-wide interpretive supremacy

---

## 1. Normative Supremacy

This document constitutes the **highest and controlling normative authority** within the GHI project.

It holds **absolute interpretive supremacy** over all prior, concurrent, or future materials, including, without limitation:
- documents,
- publications,
- phases,
- roadmaps,
- design notes,
- datasets,
- repositories,
- or any derivative, referenced, or related artifacts.

In the event of any inconsistency, ambiguity, overlap, omission, silence, or interpretive conflict,  
**this document shall prevail without exception or contextual qualification**.

---

## 2. Interpretive Exclusivity

All GHI materials shall be interpreted **exclusively** through the lens of this document.

No external doctrine, industry convention, inferred intent, contextual reading, subsequent usage, or third-party interpretation  
may be used to supplement, expand, soften, or reinterpret the scope defined herein.

Interpretation is strictly:
- textual,
- restrictive,
- non-teleological,
- and non-evolutive by implication.

---

## 3. Prohibition of Implied Enablement

No document, phase, artifact, dataset, or body of work within the GHI project shall be construed as:
- enabling,
- preparatory,
- anticipatory,
- capability-building,
- activation-adjacent,
- implementation-oriented,
- or operationally indicative,

**unless such characterization is explicitly, formally, and affirmatively authorized within this document itself.**

The absence of an explicit authorization shall be interpreted as a **binding exclusion**,  
and shall not be treated as silence, ambiguity, optionality, or deferred determination.

---

## 4. Irrelevance of Intent and Future Conditions

Stated intent, implied objectives, future-oriented language, governance roadmaps, scenarios, or conditional narratives  
shall have **no interpretive or legal effect** unless expressly incorporated and authorized herein.

No future event, including but not limited to:
- increased usage,
- external adoption,
- governance evolution,
- personnel change,
- institutional restructuring,
- or regulatory context shift,

shall modify, expand, or requalify the interpretive scope established by this document.

---

## 5. Binding Effect and Durability

This document is:
- immediately binding,
- non-revocable by implication,
- durable across governance changes,
- and survives any restructuring, succession, or reorganization of the GHI project.

Any modification, limitation, suspension, or override of this document requires an **explicit, standalone, higher-order normative instrument**  
of equal or superior authority, adopted prospectively and without retroactive effect.

Absent such an instrument, this document remains fully controlling.
