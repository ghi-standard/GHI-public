Governance Layer: v1.0

GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY AND INTERPRETIVE SCOPE

1. Normative Supremacy

This document constitutes the highest and controlling normative authority within the GHI project.

It holds absolute interpretive supremacy over all prior, concurrent, or future materials, including but not limited to:
	•	documents,
	•	publications,
	•	phases,
	•	roadmaps,
	•	design notes,
	•	datasets,
	•	repositories,
	•	or derivative artifacts.

In the event of any inconsistency, ambiguity, overlap, omission, or interpretive conflict, this document shall prevail without exception.

⸻

2. Interpretive Exclusivity

All GHI materials shall be interpreted exclusively through the lens of this document.

No external doctrine, industry practice, inferred intent, contextual reading, or subsequent usage
may be used to supplement, expand, or reinterpret the scope defined herein.

Interpretation is strictly textual, restrictive, and non-teleological.

⸻

3. Prohibition of Implied Enablement

No document, phase, artifact, or body of work within the GHI project shall be construed as:
	•	enabling,
	•	preparatory,
	•	anticipatory,
	•	capability-building,
	•	activation-adjacent,
	•	or implementation-oriented,

unless such characterization is explicitly, formally, and affirmatively authorized within this document itself.

The absence of an explicit authorization shall be interpreted as a binding exclusion, not as silence or optionality.

⸻

4. Irrelevance of Intent and Future Conditions

Stated intent, implied objectives, future-oriented language, governance roadmaps, or conditional scenarios
shall have no interpretive or legal effect unless expressly incorporated and authorized herein.

No future event, including but not limited to:
	•	increased usage,
	•	external adoption,
	•	governance evolution,
	•	personnel change,
	•	regulatory context shift,

shall alter the interpretive scope established by this document.

⸻

5. Binding Effect and Durability

This document is:
	•	immediately binding,
	•	non-revocable by implication,
	•	durable across governance changes,
	•	and survives any restructuring, succession, or reorganization of the GHI project.

Any modification to this document requires an explicit, standalone, higher-order normative instrument
of equal or superior authority.
