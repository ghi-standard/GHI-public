# REPRODUCIBILITY LIMITATION NOTICE
## Auditability-Only Reproducibility and Non-Enabling Construction

**Status:** Governance — Binding Notice  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Scope:** Methodology reproducibility narratives

---

## 1. Purpose

This notice restricts the interpretation of any “reproducibility” or “independent reproduction” statement within the GHI project.

Its purpose is to prevent any requalification of reproducibility language as:
- enablement,
- operational readiness,
- deployment facilitation,
- or commercial usability claims.

---

## 2. Reproducibility is Audit-Only

Where the GHI project references “reproducibility,” it shall be interpreted solely as:
- third-party audit verification of published descriptions,
- academic or critical review,
- methodological scrutiny for consistency.

It shall not be interpreted as:
- provision of a deployable system,
- provision of operational tooling,
- provision of production-grade outputs,
- or a representation of fitness for any specific purpose.

---

## 3. No Private Sources, No Completeness Representation

The continuity and reproducibility scope explicitly excludes private data sources.

No statement in the repository shall be interpreted as a representation that:
- all inputs are public,
- all datasets are complete,
- or results are operationally sufficient for institutional use.

---

## 4. Interpretive Effect

This notice supersedes any inconsistent implication derived from explanatory text elsewhere in the repository regarding reproducibility or third-party replication.
