# INSTITUTIONAL FREEZE NOTICE  
## Phase 2.4 — External LIVE Ingestion (Shadow Mode Design)

---

## 1. Context

The **GHI project** conducted a documented reflection identified as:

**Phase 2.4 — External LIVE Ingestion (Shadow Mode Design)**

This phase was conceived, framed, and documented **exclusively** as a **conceptual and non-operational design exercise**, explicitly characterized by all of the following conditions:

- no connection to any real or external data source,
- no ingestion of data, whether real, synthetic, simulated, or sampled,
- no generation of exploitable or consumable artifacts,
- no execution, testing, pilot, or pre-implementation activity,
- no impact on the declared baseline, existing snapshots, or the public index.

---

## 2. Formal Freeze Decision

**Phase 2.4 is hereby OFFICIALLY AND DEFINITIVELY FROZEN.**

As of this declaration, the following are strictly prohibited with respect to Phase 2.4 and its outputs:

- any development,
- any implementation,
- any experimentation,
- any activation,
- any iteration,
- any extension or derivative work.

No further action shall be undertaken on the basis of this phase.

---

## 3. Scope of the Freeze

The freeze applies **without exception** to:

- all content produced within Phase 2.4,
- all schemas, models, concepts, assumptions, diagrams, and discussions associated with this phase,
- any hypothesis or notion of external LIVE data ingestion originating from Phase 2.4.

It is expressly established that **no implicit or explicit continuity**, dependency, or trajectory exists between Phase 2.4 and any subsequent phase, whether planned or hypothetical.

---

## 4. Absence of Future Trajectory

Phase 2.4:

- does not constitute an operational preparation,
- does not constitute a technical or organizational enablement,
- does not constitute a prerequisite, intermediate, or latent step toward any future activation.

Any potential future discussion related to external LIVE data sources would require, without exception:

- the opening of a **new and independent phase**,
- a **new conceptual and institutional framing**,
- a **separate and explicit institutional decision**,
- a **fully distinct documentation set**, with no functional, doctrinal, or methodological reliance on Phase 2.4.

---

## 5. Status of the Documents

All documents produced within the scope of Phase 2.4 are:

- strictly informational,
- non-contractual,
- non-binding,
- non-opposable,
- permanently frozen in their current state.

They must not, under any circumstances:

- be interpreted as an intent to implement,
- be amended, extended, or completed,
- be used as a technical, legal, strategic, or operational foundation.

---

## 6. Definitive Closure

**Phase 2.4 is formally closed.**

Any future discussion, initiative, or analysis concerning external LIVE data ingestion **shall not**:

- rely on Phase 2.4,
- reference it as a foundation,
- invoke it as a justification,
- nor use it as a precedent of any kind.
