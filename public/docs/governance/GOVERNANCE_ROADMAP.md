# GHI — Governance Roadmap (usage-driven)

**Status:** Working draft  
**Nature:** Non-binding, conditional  
**Principle:** Governance evolves based on real-world usage and risk exposure, not on predefined timelines.

---

## Purpose

This document describes the **intended evolution of GHI governance** over time.
It does not define rules or obligations.
Its purpose is to provide clarity on **when and why governance adaptations may occur**,
based on observable usage and exposure.

This roadmap complements, but does not replace, the current governance rules defined in `GOVERNANCE.md`.

---

## Phase 0 — Founder-led baseline (current)

**Trigger**  
- Project inception and early methodological development.

**Governance characteristics**
- Project carried personally by the founder.
- Single methodology owner.
- Unilateral decision-making to preserve coherence and execution speed.
- Radical transparency as the primary trust mechanism:
  - public documentation,
  - public changelog,
  - documented decision log.
- No external funding.
- No formal advisory board or governance body.

**Objective**  
Establish a stable, reproducible and auditable methodological baseline.

---

## Phase 1 — External usage emerges

**Trigger**
- Third parties begin citing, referencing, or embedding GHI outputs
  in research, reporting, products or analytical work.

**Governance adaptations (lightweight)**
- Identification of 2–3 named external reviewers.
- Review scope limited to major methodological or governance changes.
- Reviewers provide written feedback; they are not decision-makers.
- Public responses to reviewer feedback (accepted or rejected, with rationale).
- Founder retains final decision authority.

**Objective**  
Increase credibility and resilience without introducing bureaucracy.

---

## Phase 2 — Funding or dependency increases

**Trigger**
- External funding is required or accepted, **or**
- GHI becomes materially relied upon by external stakeholders.

**Governance adaptations (selective)**
- Explicit conflict-of-interest disclosures.
- Funding diversification principles
  (no single funding source able to dominate direction or perception).
- Defined methodology change windows (periodic releases).
- Reviewer rotation (“sunset” principle) to prevent entrenchment.

**Objective**  
Protect neutrality and trust as incentives and dependencies increase.

---

## Phase 3 — Disputes or systemic reliance

**Trigger**
- Persistent disputes arise that cannot reasonably be resolved
  by founder authority alone, **or**
- GHI is treated as a de facto reference by a broad external audience.

**Governance adaptations (to be determined)**
- Evaluation of additional governance or arbitration mechanisms.
- Possible separation of roles or legal structuring,
  based strictly on observed needs and risks.

**Objective**  
Ensure long-term continuity, neutrality and legitimacy.

---

## Guiding rule

> Governance formalization is a response to **usage and risk**, not an end in itself.

---

## Notes

- This roadmap is intentionally non-dated.
- It does not commit GHI to any specific structure.
- It serves as a transparency and intent signal to external observers.
