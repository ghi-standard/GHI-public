# GHI — Separation of Concerns Notice (Normative)

## Separation principle
The public GHI repository is a documentation and governance foundation. It is not a commercial product.

## No commercial continuity
No commercial tool or private system shall be construed as an extension or operationalization of GHI unless explicitly stated in a separate higher-level instrument.

## No data dependency
Any private tool must not depend on GHI public outputs as a live feed, reference series, or benchmark baseline.

## Branding & representation
Use of the “GHI” name or materials must not imply endorsement, certification, accuracy guarantees, or suitability for decision-making.

## Precedence
This notice is normative and prevails over any inconsistent non-normative statements in the public repository.
