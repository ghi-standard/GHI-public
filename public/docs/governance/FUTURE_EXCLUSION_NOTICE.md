# FUTURE ACTIVATION AND ROADMAP EXCLUSION NOTICE
## No Implied Roadmap, No Optional Activation, No Forward Commitment

**Status:** Governance — Binding Notice  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Scope:** Future-oriented language and evolution narratives

---

## 1. Purpose

This notice restricts the interpretation of any future-oriented or evolution-related language within the GHI repository.

Its purpose is to prevent requalification of such language as:
- a roadmap commitment,
- preparatory intent,
- optional activation capability,
- or anticipatory operational direction.

---

## 2. No Forward Commitments

No text in the repository shall be interpreted as committing the project to:
- future releases,
- future implementation,
- future integrations,
- or future activation of any excluded or frozen phase.

---

## 3. Evolution Requires Standalone Governance Acts

Any change, evolution, or new mechanism—if ever adopted—must be established only by:
- a standalone governance instrument,
- explicitly titled as a decision or notice,
- versioned,
- and published with clear prospective effect.

Absent such an act, no evolution is implied.

---

## 4. Interpretive Effect

This notice supersedes any inconsistent implication derived from notes, commentary, or explanatory language elsewhere in the repository that could be construed as future intent.
