# SCOPE EXCLUSION — EXTERNAL LIVE DATA INGESTION
## Project-Wide Governance Exclusion (v1.0)

---

## 1. Purpose

This governance instrument establishes a project-wide exclusion of any topic, initiative, or activity
commonly described as “external LIVE data ingestion”.

This exclusion applies independently of any specific phase designation.

---

## 2. Scope Exclusion

The following are excluded from the GHI project scope:

- any real-time or near-real-time connection to external data sources for index computation,
- any system architecture implying continuous external data ingestion,
- any operationalization of “live ingestion” concepts, regardless of terminology used.

This exclusion applies across all phases, documents, methodologies, and technical materials.

---

## 3. No Re-Inclusion by Implication

No document, phase, roadmap, methodology, technical note, or narrative may be construed as
re-including the excluded scope by implication, adjacency, evolution, or reinterpretation.

Re-inclusion requires a standalone governance instrument explicitly declaring:
- scope re-inclusion,
- boundaries,
- and effective date.

---

## 4. Independence from Phase-Level Decisions

This exclusion operates independently from any phase-specific freeze, exclusion, or archival decision,
including but not limited to Phase 2.4.

---

## 5. Non-Admission

This document does not amend, correct, or restate any prior publication.
It operates prospectively as a governance-level scope exclusion.

---

## 6. Authority and Effect

This instrument derives its authority from the
**GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY AND INTERPRETIVE SCOPE** document
and is binding project-wide upon publication.
