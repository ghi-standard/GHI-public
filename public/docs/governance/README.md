# GHI Governance Layer

This directory contains governance-level documents with normative and interpretive authority.

These documents:
- operate prospectively,
- do not modify or restate any frozen publication,
- and define binding interpretive rules applicable across the GHI project.

In case of interpretive conflict, governance-layer documents prevail.
