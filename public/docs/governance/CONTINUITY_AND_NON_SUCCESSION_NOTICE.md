# CONTINUITY AUTHORITY LIMITATION NOTICE
## Continuity Without Succession, Delegation, or Transfer

**Status:** Governance — Binding Notice  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Scope:** Continuity and founder unavailability narratives

---

## 1. Purpose

This notice restricts the interpretation of any continuity or resilience statements within the GHI project.

Its purpose is to ensure that continuity language cannot be requalified as:
- succession planning,
- governance transfer,
- organizational continuity,
- or future operational enablement.

---

## 2. Continuity Defined Narrowly

For the avoidance of doubt, “continuity” within the GHI project means only:
- continued public availability of published materials,
- continued auditability of historical outputs,
- continued reference usability of frozen or published documents.

Continuity does not include:
- decision continuity,
- governance continuity by implied transfer,
- ongoing releases,
- or operational persistence.

---

## 3. No Delegation by Default

No delegation exists by default.

Any delegation must be:
- explicit,
- written,
- versioned,
- time-bounded,
- scope-bounded,
and published as a standalone governance instrument.

Absent such an instrument, all governance authority is **non-transferable**.

---

## 4. No Implied Reliance or Dependency

Continuity language shall not be construed as:
- an invitation to depend on future updates,
- an assurance of maintenance,
- or an obligation to support downstream users.

---

## 5. Interpretive Effect

This notice supersedes any inconsistent implication or reading derived from continuity or resilience discussions elsewhere in the repository.
