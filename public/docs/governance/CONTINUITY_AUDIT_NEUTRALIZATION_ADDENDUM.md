# CONTINUITY AUDIT NEUTRALIZATION ADDENDUM
## Global HashCost Index (GHI)

> Controlling instrument: public/docs/governance/NON_BENCHMARK_GLOBAL_NOTICE.md (prevailing).
> This addendum is normative and overrides any conflicting continuity-related language across the repository.

## 1. Purpose

This addendum exists solely to neutralize any possible inference that the repository provides:
- auditability as assurance,
- operational continuity commitments,
- availability commitments,
- maintenance or service-level obligations.

## 2. No Audit / No Assurance Construction

Any occurrence of the terms “audit”, “audited”, “audit process”, or similar wording in continuity-related documents (including frozen documents) SHALL be interpreted exclusively as:
- reproducibility review by third parties,
- documentation consistency checks,
- non-assurance, non-certification activities.

No wording shall be construed as:
- audit assurance,
- certification,
- validation of correctness,
- regulatory-grade control,
- institutional reliance basis.

## 3. No Continuity Commitment

Continuity language SHALL NOT be interpreted as any promise or commitment of:
- uptime,
- availability,
- maintenance,
- update cadence,
- succession,
- permanence,
- support, warranty, or service levels.

Any such inference is expressly disclaimed and void.

## 4. Priority

In case of ambiguity or contradiction:
1) NON_BENCHMARK_GLOBAL_NOTICE.md prevails,
2) this addendum prevails,
3) all other documents are subordinate, including frozen continuity documents.
