# TERMINOLOGY CHARTER  

Governance Layer: v1.0

## Normative Definitions and Interpretive Rules

---

## 1. Purpose

This Terminology Charter defines **normative meanings** for key terms used across the GHI project.

Its purpose is to:
- prevent semantic ambiguity,
- avoid implicit legal or operational requalification,
- and ensure consistent interpretation across governance, documentation, and publications.

This charter is **binding at the governance level**.

---

## 2. Interpretive Principle

Within the GHI project, **terminology is interpreted according to this charter**, regardless of:
- common industry usage,
- colloquial meaning,
- or external technical conventions.

Where ambiguity exists, **governance-defined meanings prevail**.

---

## 3. Definition of “Design”

Within the scope of the GHI project, the term **“Design”**:

- refers exclusively to **conceptual boundary analysis**,  
- denotes **theoretical exploration of constraints or exclusions**,  
- and **explicitly excludes** any notion of:
  - preparatory activity,
  - implementation readiness,
  - technical enablement,
  - organizational or operational intent.

The use of the term “Design” **shall not** be interpreted as:
- a precursor to implementation,
- a step toward activation,
- or an expression of future capability.

---

## 4. Definition of “Conceptual”

The term **“Conceptual”** denotes work that:

- has no operational target,
- produces no actionable specifications,
- and cannot be transitioned into execution without a separate, independent phase.

Conceptual work is **non-transferable by default**.

---

## 5. Definition of “Shadow”

The term **“Shadow”**, when used in any project context:

- denotes **non-operational and non-executable status**,
- excludes testing, simulation, or rehearsal,
- and signifies the absence of system interaction.

“Shadow” does **not** imply latency, dormancy, or future activation.

---

## 6. Definition of “Phase”

A **Phase** within the GHI project:

- is a bounded documentary construct,
- has no implicit continuity beyond its declared scope,
- and does not confer rights, expectations, or trajectories toward subsequent phases.

A phase may be frozen, excluded, or invalidated without affecting other phases.

---

## 7. Prohibition of Semantic Inference

No term used within the GHI project documentation shall be interpreted as implying:

- future activation,
- preparatory intent,
- technical readiness,
- or organizational capability,

unless such intent is **explicitly and formally declared** in a dedicated governance decision.

---

## 8. Precedence

This Terminology Charter takes precedence over:
- phase-level documentation,
- exploratory notes,
- design narratives,
- methodological descriptions.

In case of interpretive conflict, this charter is authoritative.

---

## 9. Status

This document is:
- public,
- normative,
- non-contractual,
- and effective upon publication.
