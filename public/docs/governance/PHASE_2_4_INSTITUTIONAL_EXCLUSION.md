	•	any form of activation, reactivation, revival, extension, reuse, or derivative consideration.

2. Prohibition of Interpretive Requalification

Phase 2.4 shall not, under any interpretive framework, be construed as:
	•	preparatory,
	•	enabling,
	•	anticipatory,
	•	capability-building,
	•	transitional,
	•	or indicative of any future capacity, intent, direction, or evolution of the GHI project.

within the GHI project.

Any remaining reference to Phase 2.4 exists solely as a non-operative archival record and carries:
	•	no normative authority,
	•	no interpretive weight,
	•	no decision-making relevance,
	•	and no evidentiary value beyond historical traceability.
