# NORMATIVE PRECEDENCE ORDER
## Governance-Layer Interpretive Hierarchy (v1.0)

---

## 1. Purpose

This instrument defines the binding order of precedence across governance materials and all other GHI repository content.

It exists to eliminate interpretive ambiguity created by multiple governance publications.

This document is normative at the governance level.

---

## 2. Order of Precedence (Highest to Lowest)

In any interpretive conflict, ambiguity, overlap, silence, or competing reading, the following order applies:

1) GOVERNANCE_AUTHORITY_AND_SCOPE.md
2) NORMATIVE PRECEDENCE ORDER instruments (this file)
3) Scope exclusions and phase exclusions (including Phase 2.4 instruments)
4) Terminology charter and binding definitions
5) Continuity / non-succession instruments
6) Governance process, change process, decisions registry
7) Methodology, technical documentation, APIs, dashboards, roadmaps
8) Derived artifacts and generated PDFs

Lower-ranked materials shall not override or requalify higher-ranked governance instruments.

## 3. Non-Admission

This instrument does not amend, correct, or restate any prior publication.
It operates prospectively as a hierarchy clarification.

## 4. Effect

Effective upon publication and binding project-wide.
