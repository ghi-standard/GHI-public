# Normative Precedence and Interpretation Notice

This document defines the binding order and interpretive constraints applicable
to all governance and documentation instruments of the GHI project.

## 1. Normative Precedence
In case of ambiguity or apparent conflict, the following order applies:
1. GOVERNANCE.md
2. CONTINUITY.md
3. DECISIONS.md
4. CHANGE_PROCESS.md
5. All other notices, addenda, or roadmaps

## 2. Interpretive Constraint
Any language expressing authority, supremacy, or binding effect shall be read
strictly as an internal interpretive rule and not as a claim of legal jurisdiction,
regulatory authority, or external enforceability.

## 3. Roadmap Neutralisation
Any roadmap document is non-binding, non-preparatory, and non-indicative of
future capability, intent, or commitment.

This notice is binding for interpretation purposes only.
