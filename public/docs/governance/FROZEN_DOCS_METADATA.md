# FROZEN GOVERNANCE DOCUMENTS — METADATA REGISTER
**Governance Layer:** v1.0  
**Status:** Governance — Binding (Metadata Register)  
**Effective Date:** 2026-01-08  
**Scope:** Frozen governance documents only

---

## Purpose
This register attaches non-invasive metadata to frozen governance documents.
It does not modify, amend, correct, or restate any frozen content.

---

## Frozen Documents (Intangible)
The following files are frozen and MUST NOT be edited:

1) public/docs/governance/GOVERNANCE.md  
- Governance Layer: v1.0  
- Status: Frozen (intangible)

2) public/docs/governance/GOVERNANCE_ROADMAP.md  
- Governance Layer: v1.0  
- Status: Frozen (intangible)

3) public/docs/governance/DECISIONS.md  
- Governance Layer: v1.0  
- Status: Frozen (intangible)

4) public/docs/governance/CHANGE_PROCESS.md

## Interpretive Rule
Where frozen documents omit governance-layer headers, this register governs metadata only.
Frozen content remains controlling as published.
