# GHI Governance — Regulator-Facing Addendum

## 1. Purpose and Interpretative Scope

This document is an interpretative and restrictive addendum to the GHI Governance framework.

Its sole purpose is to explicitly delimit the legal, institutional, and regulatory scope of the Global HashCost Index (GHI) standard in the context of regulatory, supervisory, or adversarial review.

This addendum prevails in case of interpretative ambiguity regarding governance authority, data publication, or methodological control.

---

## 2. Absence of Regulatory Status

The GHI standard:

- is not a regulated benchmark,
- is not intended to qualify as a benchmark under any regulatory framework,
- is not designed to be relied upon for pricing, settlement, valuation, or contractual reference,
- does not claim benchmark administrator, publisher, or supervisor status.

No provision of the GHI governance framework shall be interpreted as creating regulatory obligations or rights.

---

## 3. No Institutional or Legal Authority

Governance mechanisms described in GHI documents:

- do not constitute institutional governance,
- do not create fiduciary duties,
- do not establish oversight, supervisory, or enforcement authority,
- do not imply public or private mandate.

Repository maintainers act solely as technical custodians of an open documentation repository and do not exercise institutional power.

---

## 4. Non-Opposability and Non-Reliance

The GHI standard, its documentation, and any associated data:

- are provided for informational and documentary purposes only,
- are not legally binding,
- are not intended to be relied upon by any party for decision-making with legal, financial, or regulatory consequences.

Any reliance by third parties is voluntary, discretionary, and outside the responsibility of the GHI project.

---

## 5. Methodology and Data Governance Limitations

Control over methodology evolution:

- is limited to documentation maintenance,
- does not imply accuracy guarantees,
- does not create obligations of continuity, correction, or service provision.

Published snapshots:

- reflect historical documentation states,
- are immutable solely for traceability purposes,
- do not imply certification, validation, or endorsement of their content.

Immutability shall not be construed as data integrity assurance beyond documentation consistency.

---

## 6. Absence of Benchmark Continuity Commitment

The GHI project:

- makes no commitment regarding continuity, availability, update frequency, or maintenance duration,
- may suspend, modify, or discontinue documentation without notice,
- does not guarantee comparability across versions.

No expectation of long-term availability or methodological stability shall be inferred.

---

## 7. No External Oversight Representation

References to users, institutions, or partners:

- do not imply endorsement,
- do not imply participation in governance decisions,
- do not create advisory or supervisory roles.

No external body is represented as overseeing, validating, or approving the GHI standard.

---

## 8. Interpretation Constraint

This addendum is intentionally restrictive.

Any interpretation extending the scope, authority, or responsibility of the GHI project beyond what is explicitly stated herein is invalid.

---

## 9. Governing Law and Neutrality

This document expresses no legal position and does not submit the GHI project to any jurisdiction, regulatory regime, or supervisory authority.

It is published solely as an interpretative boundary for risk mitigation purposes.
