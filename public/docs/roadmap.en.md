---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **authoritative interpretation framework** applicable to any document
designated, titled, or presented as a “roadmap” within the GHI project.

Its purpose is to:
- prevent requalification of roadmap materials as commitments,
- neutralize any interpretive ambiguity,
- and ensure consistent institutional, regulatory, and legal reading.

This notice is **normative at the governance level**.

---

## 2. Non-Binding Nature of Roadmaps

All roadmap documents within the GHI project are:

- strictly **informative**,
- **non-binding**,
- **non-contractual**,
- and **non-commitment-based**.

They do not constitute:
- a development plan,
- an execution schedule,
- a delivery obligation,
- a capacity statement,
- or a promise of future implementation.

---

## 3. Interpretive Status of Phases and Versions

Any reference to:
- phases (e.g. Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3),
- versions (v1.x, v2.x, v3.x),
- milestones,
- timelines,
- or horizon dates (including long-term references such as “2030”),

shall be interpreted exclusively as:

> **conceptual, exploratory, and conditional projections**,  
> dependent on external, non-controlled factors.

They do not imply:
- intent to execute,
- readiness,
- technical feasibility,
- organizational commitment,
- or regulatory trajectory.

---

## 4. No Implied Capability or Activation

Roadmap content shall not be interpreted as evidence of:
- existing capabilities,
- planned activation,
- future operational deployment,
- data integration readiness,
- or institutional engagement.

Any mention of potential integrations, models, audits, or institutional usage
remains **purely hypothetical** unless explicitly validated by a separate,
formal, and published governance decision.

---

## 5. Precedence Rule

In the event of:
- ambiguity,
- interpretive conflict,
- or adversarial reading,

**this Interpretive Notice shall prevail** over:
- any roadmap document,
- any descriptive planning material,
- any visual or narrative projection.

---

## 6. Retroactive Applicability

This notice applies:
- retroactively,
- globally,
- and without limitation,

to all roadmap materials previously published,
currently published,
or published in the future under the GHI project scope.

---

## 7. Governance Authority

This notice is issued under the authority of the
**GHI Project Governance Authority** and is binding
for all interpretations of roadmap-related materials.
