# GHI Institutional Limitations and Non-Guarantees Notice

**Document type:** Institutional Notice  
**Status:** Normative (Public Reference)  
**Applies to:** GHI Phase 3 — All Public Outputs, Snapshots, Index Publications  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-11  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document formally defines the **limitations, exclusions, and non-guarantees** applicable to all GHI publications, datasets, snapshots, and derived outputs.

Its objectives are to:

- set clear institutional boundaries on what GHI does and does not guarantee;
- prevent implicit expectations regarding availability, completeness, accuracy, or timeliness;
- neutralize legal, operational, and reputational risk arising from misinterpretation;
- ensure that GHI outputs remain **reference artifacts**, not service commitments.

This notice is **normative** and applies globally across Phase 3.

---

## 2. Fundamental Positioning of GHI

GHI is:

- a **methodological and reference framework**;
- an **append-only publication system**;
- a **snapshot-based index architecture**.

GHI is **not**:
- a real-time service;
- a monitoring or alerting system;
- a data-as-a-service (DaaS) provider;
- a financial, operational, or commercial guarantee.

---

## 3. No Guarantees of Availability

### 3.1 Snapshot availability

GHI makes **no guarantee** that:
- a snapshot will be produced on any specific day;
- snapshots will be produced without interruption;
- snapshot cadence will be uninterrupted or regular.

Temporary or prolonged interruptions are acceptable and compliant.

---

### 3.2 Infrastructure and access

GHI does **not** guarantee:
- continuous system uptime;
- uninterrupted access to repositories or artifacts;
- availability of any specific file, path, or interface.

---

## 4. No Guarantees of Completeness

GHI does **not** guarantee that:
- all optional enrichment fields are present;
- all regions are covered at all times;
- all external signals are continuously available.

Absence of data does not invalidate a snapshot.

---

## 5. No Guarantees of Accuracy or Precision

### 5.1 Methodological nature

All GHI outputs are:
- methodology-driven,
- assumption-bound,
- abstraction-based.

GHI does **not** guarantee:
- factual accuracy of any economic value;
- precision at site, operator, or contract level;
- alignment with real-world costs or outcomes.

---

### 5.2 No error-free claim

GHI does **not** guarantee that:
- outputs are free of error;
- methodologies are optimal or complete;
- assumptions reflect all real-world conditions.

---

## 6. No Guarantees of Timeliness

GHI does **not** guarantee:
- real-time or near-real-time updates;
- publication within any fixed time window;
- immediate correction of discovered issues.

Delays caused by:
- technical issues,
- data availability,
- human unavailability,

are considered normal operating conditions.

---

## 7. No Retroactive Corrections

Once published:
- snapshots are immutable;
- errors, omissions, or gaps are not corrected retroactively;
- improved methodologies apply only forward.

Historical artifacts remain valid **as published**.

---

## 8. No Backfilling or Reconstruction

GHI does **not** guarantee:
- backfilling of missed snapshots;
- reconstruction of absent enrichment data;
- replay of historical ingestion pipelines.

Missing data remains missing permanently.

---

## 9. No Liability for Use or Interpretation

GHI outputs:
- are provided “as-is”;
- carry no implied fitness for any purpose;
- are not investment advice, operational guidance, or decision tools.

Users bear full responsibility for:
- interpretation,
- downstream usage,
- reliance decisions.

---

## 10. No Dependency or Continuity Obligation

GHI assumes:
- no contractual obligation toward any user;
- no duty of continuity, maintenance, or upgrade;
- no obligation to preserve compatibility or interfaces.

The project may:
- change structure,
- pause operation,
- or terminate publication,

without notice.

---

## 11. Relationship to Other Governance Documents

This notice supersedes any implied expectation not explicitly granted in:

- Network Signal Methodology
- Price and FX Methodology
- Energy Price Methodology
- External Data Integration Policy
- Data Gaps and Failure Handling Policy

In case of conflict, **this limitation notice prevails**.

---

## 12. Compliance Statement

This document ensures that:

- GHI remains a reference framework, not a service;
- operational imperfections are institutionally acceptable;
- no implicit guarantees can be inferred;
- users cannot reasonably expect continuity, completeness, or precision;
- governance boundaries are explicit and defensible.
