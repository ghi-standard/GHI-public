# GHI Label and Usage Policy

## 1. Purpose

This document defines a project-level policy governing the use of the “GHI” name,
label, and associated references within the scope of the GHI project.

This policy is internal, documentary, and non-coercive.

It does not assert trademark rights, legal ownership, or external enforceability.

## 2. Nature of the GHI Label

The “GHI” designation is a project-controlled reference used to identify
documents, datasets, methodologies, and publications that originate from,
or are explicitly aligned with, the GHI project.

This designation:
- is not a legally protected mark,
- is not asserted as a trademark or service mark,
- does not confer exclusive legal rights,
- and does not imply regulatory or institutional recognition.

---

## 3. Permitted Usage

Use of the “GHI” designation is permitted when the reference:
- accurately reflects the source or scope of the referenced material,
- does not imply endorsement, certification, or approval beyond the project,
- does not misrepresent affiliation or authority.

---

## 4. Misuse and Clarification

Where a use of the “GHI” designation is inaccurate or misleading, the project
may issue clarification or disassociation statements.

Such statements:
- are informational in nature,
- apply only within the project’s documentation and communication channels,
- do not constitute enforcement actions,
- do not imply sanctions, penalties, or legal consequences.

---

## 5. No Reliance or External Effect

This policy:
- creates no legal obligations,
- grants no rights,
- and shall not be relied upon as a basis for legal, regulatory,
  or commercial decisions.

Interpretation is limited to the internal governance framework of the GHI project.
