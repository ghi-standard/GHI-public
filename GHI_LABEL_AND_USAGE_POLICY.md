# GHI_LABEL_AND_USAGE_POLICY

Version: 1.0  
Status: Normative — Binding  
Scope: Global Hashcost Index (GHI)  
Effective date: YYYY-MM-DD

---

## 1. Purpose and Intent

This document defines the exclusive conditions under which the name, label, and designation **“GHI” (Global Hashcost Index)** may be used.

Its purpose is to:
- prevent confusion between the **GHI standard** and third-party implementations,
- protect institutional users from misrepresentation,
- establish a clear separation between **open methodology** and **certified designation**.

This policy is **normative** and overrides any interpretative ambiguity arising from other project documents.

---

## 2. Separation Between Standard and Label

### 2.1 Open Standard

The GHI methodology, documentation, and mathematical principles are published as an **open standard**.

Any third party is permitted to:
- study the methodology,
- implement it independently,
- derive calculations or datasets,
- publish results based on their own implementation.

Such use does **not** grant any right to use the name, label, or designation **“GHI”**.

---

### 2.2 The GHI Label

The term **“GHI”**, including but not limited to:
- “Global Hashcost Index”,
- “GHI Index”,
- “GHI-certified”,
- “Official GHI”,

is a **protected designation** referring exclusively to implementations that comply with the governance and certification rules defined by the GHI project.

The label represents **conformity**, not ownership of data or results.

---

## 3. What the GHI Label Signifies

The GHI label indicates only that an implementation:

- strictly follows the official GHI methodology without modification,
- respects all governance, exclusion, and scope limitation documents,
- maintains transparent versioning and traceability,
- does not introduce interpretative, predictive, or prescriptive claims.

The label **does not** imply:
- economic accuracy,
- network-wide representativeness,
- investment relevance,
- regulatory compliance,
- endorsement, recommendation, or validation.

---

## 4. Prohibited Uses

The following uses are explicitly prohibited without written authorization:

- presenting an index as “GHI” or “based on GHI” if the methodology is modified,
- implying official status, endorsement, or certification,
- using the GHI name in marketing, investor materials, or financial products,
- creating derivative labels that create confusion with GHI.

Any such use constitutes **misrepresentation**.

---

## 5. Certification Eligibility

An implementation may be eligible for the GHI label only if it:

- applies the methodology exactly as defined,
- uses unaltered assumptions and parameters,
- complies with all interpretative exclusions,
- maintains full auditability of data sources and computation steps,
- refrains from financial, predictive, or advisory claims.

Certification is granted at the **sole discretion** of the GHI governance authority.

---

## 6. Automatic Loss of Eligibility

Any implementation that:
- modifies,
- simplifies,
- extends,
- reinterprets,
- or selectively applies

any part of the GHI methodology **automatically and irreversibly loses** any eligibility to the GHI label.

Forking is permitted.  
Label usage is not.

---

## 7. No Transfer of Authority

Use of the GHI label:
- does not transfer ownership,
- does not create partnership,
- does not grant governance rights,
- does not imply continuity or delegation.

All authority remains exclusively with the GHI governance framework.

---

## 8. Enforcement and Disclaimer

Failure to comply with this policy may result in:
- public disassociation,
- withdrawal of label eligibility,
- formal notice of misrepresentation.

GHI reserves the right to clarify, amend, or enforce this policy without retroactive obligation.

---

## 9. Governing Interpretation

This policy shall be interpreted:
- restrictively,
- conservatively,
- in favor of preventing confusion and misuse.

In case of conflict, this document **prevails** over any descriptive or methodological document.
